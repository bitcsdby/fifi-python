Fifi-Python
===========
This package contains high-level python bindings for the Fifi Finite Field
library. The bindings provide access to the arithmetic operations provided by
Fifi.

Installation
============
We provide a pip package for easy installation of the fifi-python
library.

To install this you'll need python and pip installed:
 - To get python `go here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
 - To install pip `follow this guide
   <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_.

Depending on your platform, additional requirements may be needed.
This is due to the fact that we only provide pre-built versions for some
specific configurations, but not all.

This table shows which platforms are supported by a wheel (pre-built) and which
are supported by a source package.

+---------------------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+
| Platform / Python version | MacOS X 64-bit | Linux 32-bit | Linux 64-bit | Windows 32-bit | Windows 64-bit |
+===========================+================+==============+==============+================+================+
| **Python 2.7 32-bit**     | -              |  Source      |  -           | **Wheel**      | **Wheel**      |

+---------------------------+----------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+

If we do not have a pre-built version for your configuration, you'll need the
requirements specified in *Requirements for Building From Source* (see below)
to install the package.

The next steps will be platform-dependent.

Linux / Mac
-----------
When you are ready to install the package, you can simply type::

  sudo pip install fifi

Windows
-------
To enable the use of pip from the command line, ensure that the ``Scripts``
subdirectory of your Python installation is available on the system ``PATH``.
(This is not done automatically.)

When you are ready to install the package, you can simply type::

  pip install fifi


Requirements for Building From Source
=====================================
Depending on your platform, different steps are needed for building
fifi-python.

Please note that a recent C++11 compiler is required. The compilers used by
Steinwurf are listed on the `buildbot page <http://buildbot.steinwurf.com>`_.

Linux
-----
These steps may not work with your specific Linux distribution, but they may
guide you in the right direction.

First, acquire the required packages from your package management system::

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python git build-essential libpython-dev

If you are using Python 3, you'll need to install ``libpython3-dev`` instead.

MacOS
-----

Follow `this guide
<https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#setting-up-git>`_ to install git.

Install Xcode and Command-line Tools from the Mac Store.

Windows
-------
Install a 32-bit Python and Visual Studio 2013 (Express).
Now set the following environment variable ``VS90COMNTOOLS`` to::

  C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\

so that Python distutils can detect your new compiler.

Building From Source
====================
Now that you have all requirements, you are ready to clone, configure and build
the project::

    git clone https://github.com/steinwurf/fifi-python.git

configure and build the project::

  cd fifi-python
  python waf configure
  python waf build

Now the project is built and you should be able to find the resulting
fifi.so file here (the actual path is dependent on your OS)::

  build/linux/src/fifi_python/fifi.so

You can add this path to your PYTHONPATH and import the module in your Python
script::

  >>> import fifi
